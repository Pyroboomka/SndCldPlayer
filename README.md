# TBD checklist
- [x] Routing! //somewhat, still needs further improvements
- [ ] Moved to Important! Css => SASS. This is getting out of hand pretty quickly.
- [ ] Important: Rethink if I should follow DRY here with mobile components.
- [ ] Important : fix duplicate songs receiving (thx flattenChildren)
- [x] Seeking in player component
- [ ] Infinite scrolling to get new songs
- [ ] Comments
- [ ] Users and single songs components
- [ ] Surpass soundredux
