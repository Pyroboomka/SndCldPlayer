# SndcldPlayer

Yet another one soundcloud client, made with React+Redux
Inspired by well-known [SoundRedux](http://soundredux.io)

# Installation

# TBD checklist
[ ] Important : fix duplicate songs receiving (thx flattenChildren)
[ ] Seeking in player component
[ ] Infinite scrolling to get new songs
[ ] Comments
[ ] Users and single songs components
[ ] Css => SASS
[ ] Tests
[ ] Surpass soundredux
